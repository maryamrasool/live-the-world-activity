# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Libraries/Tools Used

This project uses React, TypeScript and relies on Tailwind css for styling of the form component. Additionally, it uses the following packages:

1. react-loading-spin
2. react-modal
3. react-multi-carousel
4. @tailwindcss/line-clamp
5. react-router-dom
6. axios

## Possible Enhancements

This was an attempt to create something similar to https://www.livetheworld.com/activities/belgium/castle-of-gerald-the-devil and not replicate it. Hence, there are a lot of UI components that can be modified for better user experience
